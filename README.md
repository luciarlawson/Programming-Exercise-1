Documentation for my website

Navigation - All pages have a functioning nav bar that allows you to navigate from page to page. The colour of the nav bar matches the banner image at the top of each page. The colour scheme of blue is meant to represent the seaside element of North Berwick. The towns name (North Berwick) and the region (East Loathian) are both included in the nav. There is a hover element on each section of the nav so users know they can click on it. Whichever page the user is on is highlighted in a lighter shade of blue. The nav bar is also 'sticky', meaning users can always see it even when they scroll down the page. I think this makes navigation easier because you don't have to scroll back to the top of the page to change pages.


Layout - Each of the three webpages has a similar layout. They all have the same navigation bar, banner image and footer. I think this makes it easy to navigate the website and user friendly. The content of each page is centered on the page and is displayed using similar layouts. 

The homepage has some text information alongside a couple of images relating to the text. I think this simple layout makes it easy for users to see the information but it isn't to much reading as there are images to 'break' the text into sections. Underneath this there is a interactive map for users to see the location of North Berwick.

The historypage has two bodys of text and two couples of images next the the relating text. Again I think having images withing the text makes it easer to read.

The visitpage has information displayed using what I this is a widget. The top 5 things to do in North Berwick are displayed one after another within the widget. There are some links with the body of the text to take you to pages about North Berwick and where to book experiences. At the bottom of the page there are five images, each relating to one of the experiences mentioned above.


Colour Choices - I choose diferent shades of blue for all the sections in my website. Most of the images I have used contain the sea or blue skys. The images and the colour choice reflect the feel of being in North Berwick, a sunny seaside town.


Challenges - The main challenge I faced was implementing bootstrap into my website rather than hard coding in CSS. I had to work out what I could use bootstrap for and what I should code in CSS. Origionally I had coded a fully functional navigation bar using only CSS. While this worked, I relised it would be more efficient to use bootstrap. My nav bar has now been made with bootstrap and I think this is much more efficient.
