                <h2>A Brief History of North Berwick</h2>
                <p>
                    North Berwick is a historic seaside town in East Lothian, 
                    Scotland, with roots stretching back to ancient times. 
                    Archaeological evidence suggests early settlements in the 
                    area, and by the 12th century, the town had become an important 
                    religious center with the establishment of North Berwick Priory. 
                    Its harbor also played a key role in ferrying pilgrims to St 
                    Andrews.<br><br>
                    For centuries, North Berwick remained a small fishing and farming 
                    community, but this changed in the 19th century with the arrival 
                    of the railway. The town became a popular Victorian seaside resort, 
                    known for its scenic coastline, golf courses, and beaches. Today, 
                    it is a thriving tourist destination, famous for its links golf, 
                    the Scottish Seabird Centre, and the nearby Bass Rock, home to one 
                    of the world’s largest gannet colonies.

                <p>The North Berwick Witch Trials were one of Scotland’s most infamous 
                    witch hunts, taking place between 1590 and 1592. The trials were 
                    sparked by King James VI’s growing obsession with witchcraft, 
                    particularly after a storm disrupted his voyage from Denmark, which 
                    he believed was caused by witches.<br><br>
                    Dozens of people, including Agnes Sampson, a respected midwife, 
                    and Dr. John Fian, a schoolmaster, were accused of gathering at 
                    North Berwick Kirk to perform dark magic against the king. Many 
                    were tortured into confessing and later executed, mainly by 
                    strangulation and burning at the stake.<br><br>
                    These trials played a key role in Scotland’s wider witch-hunting 
                    frenzy. The North Berwick Witch Trials remain one of the earliest 
                    and most notorious witch hunts in Scottish history.
